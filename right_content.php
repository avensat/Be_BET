<h2><a id="carry-it" name="carry-it"></a>Carry it everywhere you go</h2>
<p>It is a good idea to always carry your personal health care card. If you travel outside of Alberta or Canada, you should carry your card as well, just in case you need medical services when you’re away from home.</p>
<p>Alberta Health covers only some limited physician and hospital expenses outside Alberta. It is strongly recommended that Alberta residents carry private supplementary insurance when travelling outside of Alberta to cover unforeseen emergency care and transportation, as these costs may be significant. </p>
